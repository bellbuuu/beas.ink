    <h4>i heard this in some youtube video. "aren't you curious about your upper limit?". shit hit me like a train. i have moments when, for instance i finished building this entire site in one sitting, in four hours (with a little pre-planning def), all motivated, all fired up.
        i also have moments i do nothing except maybe watching emma chamberlain's two year old vlogs. again. <br>
        im learning. i hate learning. i also love learning. but it's boring. but i want to make more projects!!! it just goes on... <br>
        ah, but one thing i know. six of these projects combined were made in just one summer. before that, i knew nothing. everyone starts somewhere. so, i'll be fine ig? </h4>
